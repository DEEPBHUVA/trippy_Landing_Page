        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>Trippy aims to simplify and improve travel planning through what they call "friend-sourcing."The app ties into users' social networks, such as Facebook, to discover which friends, family and contacts have visited the considered destination—whether it be that they've checked-in, lived, worked, or studied there. Through one-click recommendations and Facebook-style commenting, Trippy lets friends suggest what hotels, restaurants, and destinations would be a good fit.The startup offers an auto-complete tool to quickly pull up what you're looking for — from a database of locations. Users can then add places they're considering so that friends can comment on the itinerary, offering feedback in Facebook-style comment feeds.</p>

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

        <h1>Our Visions</h1>
        <p>Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology</p>
